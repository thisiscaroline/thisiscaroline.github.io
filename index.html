	<h3><em>Dear Reader,</em></h3>
	<p>If you have stumbled upon this page entirely by accident, I should urgently remind you 
		that it is never too late to turn back. What follows here is the homepage and 
		personal <em>tour de force</em> - a phrase which here means, "a magpielike 
		assembly of whimsical achievement" - of the creator; said creator, of course, 
		being myself.</p>
	<p>As this is my website, I am captain of both its success and its failure, but
		there is no good reason why anyone else should join such a perilous voyage. 
		The crew has jumped ship, the first mate is a Labrador, and among other things, the 
		cargo contains various mentions of computer science, hard work and perserverance, 
		literary allusions, the state of New Jersey, a second-place spelling bee trophy, 
		and slavish loyalty to the Oxford comma.</p>
	<p>I cannot stop you from venturing forth; I can only plead with you to reconsider and
		swim back to shore, or at least perhaps to a nice, safe wading pool. The webpages ahead are
		teeming with handcrafted code and job-seeking qualifications, and the creator/captain/me 
		is lashed to the bow of this ship, ready to set sail on the journey of a lifetime. But 
		if such journeys sound too exciting and adventurous for you, please feel free to disembark.</p>
	<h3><em>With all due respect,</em></h3>
	<p>Caroline Swinyer</p>
