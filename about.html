	<h1>To no one's surprise, I am Caroline.</h1>
	<p>I'm a twenty five-year-old recent college graduate, aspiring computer scientist 
	with the degree to prove it, passionately amateur writer, and staunch defender of 
	the Oxford comma. I have a keen interest in both furthering my understanding of the world of backend 
	programming, as well as developing an appreciation for the complexities of frontend 
	work. My most recent sights have been set on a thorough knowledge of familiar languages 
	(Java, C), as well as immersing myself in newer ones (Python, Objective-C, Javascript).</p>
	<p>The other linguistic love of my life is English, in case you couldn't tell. I have been 
	writing for over a decade, sticking mostly to the wild world of fiction, for no other 
	reason beyond loving what I do and the sheer desire to create. I've learned how to accept 
	- and especially ask - for valid criticism, how to edit my work, how to engage an audience, 
	how to take the dive and meet a deadline and publish a piece I'm proud of. Writing samples 
	can be made available upon request.</p>
	<p>My goal in life is to be proud of what I accomplish. For that reason, my site's mascot, 
	so to speak, is the first ever puppy I've raised for The Seeing Eye. Halston was my constant 
	companion through my senior year of college and for several months afterward, as I raised her 
	from seven weeks of age until fourteen months. She taught me true selfnessness, dedication, and
	how to learn from your mistakes - as a first time raiser we had more than our fair share. 
	Keeping her picture on my website is a personal reminder to always try my best, and to 
	be proud of not only how far I've come, but of how far I know I can go.</p>
	<!--<p>I can also rap Em's verse in "Forgot About Dre." Trust me, that's important.</p>-->
