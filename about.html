	<h1>A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...</h1>
	<p>I've actually only ever seen <em>A New Hope.</em> I hope that's not a dealbreaker.</p>
	<p>This is the homepage and personal site for a recenot college graduate 
		who sort of just found the yellow brick road out of Munchkinland and decided hey, it 
		might lead somewhere interesting. She's notoriously chock-full of pop culture references, 
		is an unabashed dog <em>and</em> cat person, fits more than one of the stereotypes about 
		millennials, and was never good at filling out the "About Me" section of anything, anyway.</p>
